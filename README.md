# 3-column preview card component

![Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My task was to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Where to find everything

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs meant that I needed to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

## Building your project
## Steps:

1. Initialized the project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configured the repository to publish my code to a web address. 
3. Looked through the designs to start planning out how I'll tackle the project. This step was crucial to help me think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Wrote out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Started adding styles to the top of the page and worked down. Only moved on to the next section once I was happy with the code I was working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. My recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I am always looking to improve my skills. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please let me know.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
